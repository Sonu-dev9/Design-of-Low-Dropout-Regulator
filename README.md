Design-of-Low-Dropout-Regulator
Designing an LDO Regulator for 1.5V and Load Current range of 100nA-100mA. The design incorporates a current reference generation circuit along with a single-stage folded cascode op-amp
The design and simulation have been performed in the Cadence Virtuoso (simulator), and the technology used for the simulation is tsmcN65.
The circuit diagram of the LDO architecture is as follows:
